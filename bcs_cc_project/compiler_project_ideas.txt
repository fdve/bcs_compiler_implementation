- add visual representation of several stages?
	(so visual representation of the lexical / syntax / semantical phase, for educational / debugging / overview purposes?)
		-> how to inject / build that code, independantly of the compiler itself.
		   So it should be trivial to run the code without the visual component,
		   without still having a performance deficit etc.
