The Compiler can be compiled using the make command, followed
by passing a Star source file to the compiled binary : 
make;
./star_compiler my_star_source_file.star 

Sample star source files can be find in the ./source/test_framework/tests directroy

Compiling required gcc?, make, flex and bison, 

Tested on 5.10.16.3-microsoft-standard-WSL2 Linux kernel.

The /source directory is where the source code of the compiler resides.
Each subdirectory within the source directory has its own README file.
