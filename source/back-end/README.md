The back-end of the Star compiler consist of the file asmcodegen.cpp. This file defines parameter number to register mappings for x86-64 function call procedures, formats the Assembly, iterates over all the given Quadruples from the middle-end, generates appropriate x86-64 Assembly and so on. It takes care of all the tasks which are required in order to generate the x86-64 Assembly.
