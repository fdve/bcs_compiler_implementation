The test framework makes use of the google test frame [insert link here].

The input tests are located in the front-end and back-end directory (there is no middle-end testing at the moment).

### Front-end testing
Front-end testing works by  
    (1) either parsing the test file and checking if parsing errors occured.
    (2) parsing and then performing semantic analysis, checking e.g whether any
        type incompatible or function call paramater mismatch errors happen.

After that the test starts with checking that the expected amount of error messages has been generated by the error logger. Following, expected error messages are compared to the actual error messages present in the ErrorLogger::errorMsgs vector.


### Back-end testing
To test the compilers generated assembly, first the assembly files have to be generated from the test input files, this happens in gtest_asmfilegen.cpp.

Following, in gtest_main.cpp the gtests are compiled together with the generated asm files, where the test functions in gtest_main.cpp will be calling and executing the compiled generated assembly functions to their expected return values.

The generated assembly files are put in the /gen_asm_files directory. The mandatory start() method from the Star source file gets translated to a test_x function label, with a .globl prefix so that the assembler knowns that the function will be accessible from outside the current file.

For compiled assembly files which return a float value, the source Star files will contain a start method and a seperate test method which is basically the test and returns the float value. The .globl directive will be followed by the name of the seperate test method.
